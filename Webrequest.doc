Understanding web request.
Hyper text transfer protocol (HTTP)
Our pc/mobile will send a request(GET) to the server and the server will send back a response (Headers
and body or simply the HTML) in JSON/XML form.
The post request is different from the GER request mainly for one reason, that is 
the post request post something new to the server( for example if a user finishes a certain type of course or step.)
PUT request is where you modify existing data ( for example a user changed their login details.)
Delete request is when you remove a record.
